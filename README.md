# Django_WebProject

The purpose of this project was to provide small groups with the means to collect, share, and distribute information securely.  Files and messages exchanged on the app may be encrypted (AES 256), and the repo provides an FDA, or File Download Application, that can both encrypt and decrpyt files on the system. This project was completed with a team of 4 software developers, including myself, and was deoployed on Heroku.
